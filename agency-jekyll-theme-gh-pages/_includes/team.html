                    <p class="team-feature-description text-muted">Hi, I&rsquo;m K&#305;van&ccedil; - a Toronto-based sound designer. Over the years, my path in audio has taken me through a range of roles and disciplines. With degrees in Jazz and Sonic Arts, my background spans from arranging jazz to designing interactive music systems for games.</p>
                    <p class="team-feature-description text-muted">I create stylistically accurate and technically well-structured audio tailored to each game&rsquo;s needs. I&rsquo;ve worked as the full-time audio department for two game studios and continue to collaborate on projects as a freelance sound designer. The games I&rsquo;ve worked on have explored themes ranging from sci-fi and medieval worlds to farming, house decoration, and even vampires.</p>
                    <p class="team-feature-description text-muted">If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about my experience or get in touch, feel free to reach out.</p>
