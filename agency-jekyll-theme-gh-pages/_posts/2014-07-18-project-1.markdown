  One of my past projects, Beatpunk, explored the intersection of gameplay and
  music composition. It was a bullet heaven game built around a 4-bar looping
  synthwave structure, where guitar, synth, drums, and bass were divided into
  two-beat musical samples written in D minor. As players gained experience,
  they activated these musical layers in real time - effectively composing the
  soundtrack through gameplay. Each musical element was tied to abilities, and
  as the track evolved, the character's attacks evolved with it. The result was
  a system where music wasn't just background - it was the combat system.
